# Data Centralization Platform

Transforming scattered data sources into unified, LLM-ready knowledge bases

Enterprise-grade platform for aggregating data from multiple APIs, databases, and services into centralized datasets optimized for custom language model training and business intelligence. Demonstrates real-world data fusion patterns used in production environments.


## 🎯 Project Purpose

This platform showcases advanced data integration capabilities by collecting related information from diverse sources and creating unified datasets that enable AI models to discover fascinating cross-domain connections. The architecture mirrors enterprise data centralization patterns while preparing datasets for custom LLM training.
Data Connection Examples

🌤️ Weather + Music: Climate conditions during famous album recordings and releases
📺 Entertainment + Geography: Cultural events mapped to regional weather patterns
🎵 Music + Events: Historical context surrounding influential song releases
🌍 Geographic + Cultural: Regional music trends correlated with environmental data


## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Built with production-ready patterns including:

Package-based design with shared libraries
Environment-driven configuration
Domain-organized services
GraphQL & REST API integration
Containerized microservices
LLM-optimized data formatting


## 🔌 Data Source Integrations

Music & Entertainment APIs

Spotify API (REST) - Track metadata, artist information, audio features
MusicBrainz API (REST) - Open music database with release details
TMDb API (REST) - Movie and TV show information with release dates

### Environmental & Reference APIs
OpenWeatherMap API (REST) - Historical and current weather data
GitHub GraphQL API - Repository analytics and development activity


## 🤖 AI/LLM Integration Strategy
Data Preparation for Custom Models
python# Example: Cross-domain knowledge preparation
{
  "knowledge_entry": {
    "primary_entity": "Led Zeppelin IV",
    "release_date": "1971-11-08",
    "recording_location": "London, UK",
    "weather_context": {
      "temperature": "12°C",
      "conditions": "Overcast",
      "season": "Autumn"
    },
    "cultural_context": {
      "major_events": ["Vietnam War ongoing", "Beatles disbanded"],
      "chart_position": "#2 UK Albums"
    },
    "connections": [
      "Similar weather patterns during other classic rock recordings",
      "Autumn album releases trend in 1970s progressive rock"
    ]
  }
}

### Training Data Formats
JSON knowledge graphs for entity relationships
Conversational datasets for question-answering
Multi-modal data linking audio features to environmental context
Temporal sequences for trend analysis and prediction


## 🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites

Python 3.9+
Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
API keys for integrated services

Quick Setup
bash# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/[username]/data-centralization-platform.git
cd data-centralization-platform

### Install packages in development mode
pip install -e packages/shared_core
pip install -e packages/workflows

### Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
### Add your API keys to .env

### Run initial data collection
python services/data_collection/music_collector/main.py


## 🎵 Music Data Integration Highlights

This platform demonstrates sophisticated music data centralization by connecting:

Artist discographies with recording locations and weather data
Song releases with historical events and cultural context
Audio features with environmental and geographic patterns
Listening trends with seasonal and regional variations


## 🤖 Custom LLM Training Applications

Knowledge Domains

Music History & Context: "What was happening in the world when this song was recorded?"
Environmental Correlations: "How does weather influence music creation and popularity?"
Cultural Pattern Recognition: "What regional factors influence musical styles?"
Cross-Domain Discovery: "Find unexpected connections between data sources"
